observations gathered from results.csv file containing error/repair pairs and error/repair frequencies

for rows in results.csv that are empty, the mistake was a spacing issue
for rows in results.csv without frequencies or equal frequencies either:
    - the typo or repair are not english words in the US-SUBLTEX corpus
    - both the typo and repair are the same word with different capitliazation within the word
    - an omission occured

if the error and repair entries are numbers, the repair increments one of the numbers by 1
this is likely from updating a version number (ie. [1.1.4,1.1.5],[0.2,0.3],etc.)

in cases without omissions:

when error frequency = 0 and repair frequency > 0, the error is a mispeeling of the repair:
    - mispellings are often:
        two letters swapped- ie. recieve/receive
        an extra doubled letter- ie. begginer/beginner
        an omitted letter- ie. cntribute/contribute
        an incorrect letter adjacent to the correct letter on the keyboard- ie. conferting/converting


when error frequency > 0 and repair frequency > 0:
    - the error and repair are the same noun in singular & plural form. The user often removes
      or adds the "s"
    - the error and repair are antonyms (ie [push,pop] [minimuim,maximum], etc)
    - the error and repair are the same length and 1 letter off (ie [to,of],[is,it],[is,it])
      these are usually two letter words
    - the error and repair are closely related in part of speech (ie. [so,but],[be,able])

interestingly, in cases where both the error word and repair word are both found in US-SUBLTEX,
the error word often has a higher frequency than the repair word.

in cases with omissions:

the omitted word is often an article, a single character or punctuation.
It is rare that an omitted word is long/multisyllabic
